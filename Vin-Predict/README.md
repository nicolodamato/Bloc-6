# Full Stack projects
It's now time to work on your final projects. These will validate your newly acquired skills in Data Science. Let's take a look at what a successful project should look like.

Project Goal
First, your project is about researching and managing a Data Science project end to end. Your goal will be to showcase the skills that make a good Data Scientist or Analyst. The best way to do so is to think of an industry or field that motivates you, find data sources connected to that subject, and think of a data driven way to deliver value for that sector, or solve one of their problems.
